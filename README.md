# IMDB_Tableau

I created this project to choose films for evenings that  AI can't (not yet) recommend to me

Python notebook I used to transform data for the dashboard https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/anton2383/viz/IMDBmoviesoverview/Matrixlongdashboard?publish=yes
The project contain data from IMDB database. The database contain movies, series, shorts, tvseries, etc.
The selection based on rating, number of votes, genre and period.

Here is the links to IMDB database:
